	abstract = {The T-matrix ({TMAT}) of a scatterer fully describes the way the scatterer interacts with incident fields and scatters waves, and is therefore used extensively in several science and engineering applications. The T-matrix is independent of several input parameters in a wave propagation model and hence the offline computation of the T-matrix provides an efficient reduced order model ({ROM}) framework for performing online scattering simulations for various choices of the input parameters. The authors developed and mathematically analyzed a numerically stable formulation for computing the T-matrix (J. Comput. Appl. Math. 234 (2010), 1702--1709). The {TMATROM} software package provides an object-oriented implementation of the numerically stable formulation and can be used in conjunction with the user’s preferred forward solver for the two-dimensional Helmholtz model. We compare {TMATROM} with standard methods to compute the T-matrix for a range of two-dimensional test scatterers with large aspect ratios and acoustic sizes. Our numerical results demonstrate the robust numerical stability of the {TMATROM} implementation, even with scatterers for which the standard methods are numerically unstable. The efficiency and flexibility of the {TMATROM} software package to handle a wide range of two-dimensional scatterers with various shapes and material properties are also demonstrated.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05427},
	abstract = {We formally deduce closed-form expressions for the transmitted effective wavenumber of a material comprising multiple types of inclusions or particles (multi-species), dispersed in a uniform background medium. The expressions, derived here for the first time, are valid for moderate volume fractions and without restriction on the frequency. We show that the multi-species effective wavenumber is not a straightforward extension of expressions for a single species. Comparisons are drawn with state-of-the-art models in acoustics by presenting numerical results for a concrete and a water-oil emulsion in two dimensions. The limit of when one species is much smaller than the other is also discussed and we determine the background felt by the larger species in this limit. Surprisingly, we show that the answer is not the intuitive result predicted by self-consistent multiple scattering theories. The derivation presented here applies to the scalar wave equation with cylindrical or spherical inclusions, with any distribution of sizes, densities, and wave speeds. The reflection coefficient for cylindrical inclusions is also formally derived.},
