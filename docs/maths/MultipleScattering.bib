	abstract = {Scattering of plane elastic waves by a spherical inclusion is considered. A unified method of solution is presented which treats compressional and shear incidence on a similar basis. Explicit results are given for Rayleigh scattering. We apply the results of the single scattering problem to the propagation of low frequency waves in a composite containing a dilute concentration of spherical inclusions. Explicit formulae are given for the effective wave speeds and attenuations when the inclusions are voids. Both the compressional and shear wave speeds decrease initially as a function of frequency.},

	abstract = {The absorption of sound in emulsions and suspensions is due to viscous and thermal transport processes occurring at the interface of the nonhomogeneities, as well as to the intrinsic absorption in the materials comprising the system. A complete description of these processes for systems of fluid particles suspended in fluid media was given by Epstein and Carhart [J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 25, 553 (1953)]. However, subsequent investigators of liquid systems have generally neglected the thermal transport process. We show in this work that the Epstein‐Carhart results provide a good description of our experimental attenuation data in emulsions, and that the thermal transport process can be the major factor in the attenuation. We have here also extended the theory further to include the attenuation in suspensions of solid particles, and good agreement is found between our theory and experimental results for aqueous suspensions of polystyrene spheres.},

	abstract = {The interaction of waves with obstacles is an everyday phenomenon in science and engineering, arising for example in acoustics, electromagnetism, seismology and hydrodynamics. The mathematical theory and technology needed to understand the phenomenon is known as multiple scattering, and this book is the first devoted to the subject. The author covers a variety of techniques, describing first the single-obstacle methods and then extending them to the multiple-obstacle case. A key ingredient in many of these extensions is an appropriate addition theorem: a coherent, thorough exposition of these theorems is given, and computational and numerical issues around them are explored. The application of these methods to different types of problems is also explained; in particular, sound waves, electromagnetic radiation, waves in solids and water waves. A comprehensive bibliography of some 1400 items rounds off the book, which will be an essential reference on the topic for applied mathematicians, physicists and engineers.},

Each cylinder is penetrable, with a sound-speed that is close to that in the exterior: the scattering is said to be “weak”. Two classes of methods are used. The first is usually associated with the names of Foldy and Lax. Such methods require a “closure assumption”, in addition to the governing equations. The second class is based on iterative approximations to integral equations of Lippmann–Schwinger type. Such methods do not use a closure approximation. Our main result is that both approaches lead to exactly the same formulas for the effective wavenumber, correct to second-order in scattering strength and second-order in filling fraction. Approximations for the average wavefield are also derived and compared.},

	abstract = {We present a topical review which summarizes the main contributions to ‘multiple scattering of acoustic and elastic waves’ including the most recent advances. The review is divided into five main parts. In the first part, the effects of multiple scattering on ultrasonic propagation are illustrated on the basis of three experimental examples. In the second and third parts, we present the two possible descriptions for the propagation of an acoustic wave in a random medium. The first one is based on the study of the coherent wave, i.e. the wave amplitude averaged over disorder, whereas the second one deals with the propagation of the incoherent intensity, i.e. the intensity averaged over disorder. We especially insist on the microscopic basis for the phenomenological radiative transfer equation and show how it can be solved in the diffusion approximation. The theory is illustrated with experimental results obtained on a two-dimensional multiple-scattering prototype made of thousands of steel rods randomly distributed and immersed in water. In the fourth part, we present experimental evidence that the diffusion equation fails in describing all the aspects of the propagation of an acoustic wave in a random medium: e.g. the coherent backscattering effect recently observed for ultrasonic waves. We show that this effect arises as a consequence of reciprocity. Finally, in the fifth part, we discuss another property which is not taken into account in the radiative transfer theory: the reversibility of an acoustic wave propagating in a disordered medium.},

Unlike a previous development based upon energy conservation considerations [J. A. Turner and R. L. Weaver, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 93, 2312 (A) (1993)] for a medium containing discrete random scatterers, the present model has been developed from the wave equation and first principles. Appropriate ensemble averaging of the wave equation leads to Dyson and Bethe–Salpeter equations which govern the mean Green’s function and the covariance of the Green’s function, respectively. These equations are expanded for weak heterogeneity and equations of radiative transfer are obtained. The result is valid for attenuations that are small compared with a wave number: α/k≪1. Polarization effects are included, as before, through five elastodynamic Stokes parameters, one longitudinal and four shear. The theory is applied to a statistically homogeneous and statistically isotropic half‐space composed of cubic crystallites illuminated by a plane wave. Results for the angular dependence of backscattered intensity are presented. It is anticipated that this approach may be applicable to microstructural characterization through the study of the time, space, ultrasonic frequency, and angular dependence of multiply scattered ultrasound in elastic media.},

The scattering interactions were modeled with vector multipole functions and boundary condition solutions for each particle. Multiple scattering was simulated by translating the scattered wave fields from one particle to another with the use of translational addition theorems, summing the multiple-scattering contributions, and recalculating the scattering using an iterative method. The approach can simulate 3D dispersions with a variety of particle sizes, compositions, and volume fractions. To test the model, spectra and wave field images were generated from ordered and disordered microstructures containing up to several thousand particles. The model predicted wave propagation phenomena such as refractive focusing and mode conversion.

The random medium is modeled by a layer of randomly distributed dielectric spherical scatterers, bounded on top and bottom by a rough surface. The phase matrix for the discrete spherical scatterers is evaluated using the dense medium phase and amplitude correction ({DM}-{PACT}) method (Chuah et al., 1996) so that it can be used for a dense medium (such as snow and sea-ice). This phase matrix differs from the conventional one in that both amplitude and phase corrections for the close-spacing effect are considered. The rough surface is modeled using the integral equation method ({IEM}) (Fung, 1994). The problem is formulated by using radiative transfer theory. The integrodifferential equations are solved using an iterative method. Explicit expressions up to second-order solutions are given. Based on these solutions, terms resulting from three major scattering mechanisms, namely, direct surface, surface–volume, and volume scattering terms, can be identified. The volume interactions include both direct volume and volume–volume interactions. Using this model, dense medium effect and relative contributions of the three major scattering mechanisms are investigated. The study of relative contributions of the various scattering mechanisms is important to indicate the conditions under which a simple incoherent theory, where backscatter returns are obtained by direct addition of volume and direct surface terms, is acceptable. Comparisons are also made with measurements in the laboratory and in the field.},

In this paper, the phase matrix of a dense discrete random medium is developed by relaxing the far-field approximation and accounting for the effect of volume fraction and randomness properties characterized by the variance and correlation function of scatterer positions within the medium. The final expression for the phase matrix differs from the conventional one in two major aspects: there is an amplitude and a phase correction. The concept used in the derivation is analogous to the antenna array theory. The phase matrix for a collection of scatterers is found to be the Stokes matrix of the single scatterer multiplied by a dense medium phase correction factor. The close spacing amplitude correction appears inside the Stokes matrix. When the scatterers are uncorrelated, the phase correction factor approaches unity. The phase matrix is used to calculate the volume scattering coefficients for a unit volume of spherical scatterers, and the results are compared with calculations from other theories, numerical simulations, and laboratory measurements. Results indicate that there should be a distinction between physically dense medium and electrically dense medium},

Comparisons are made with results obtained by using the effective field approximation and the quasicrystalline approximation. Numerical results of the effective dielectric constant and the scattering attenuation rates, as a function of the fractional volume occupied by the scatterers, are illustrated using parameters frequently encountered in the microwave remote sensing of snow and soil moisture.

We set forth the conditions for the effect of coherent-transmittance quenching, which takes place as a result of the interference between incident and forward-scattered waves. Using the single-scattering approximation we determined size parameters and particle refractive indexes for this interference effect in the case of identical isotropic spherical particles. The influence of polydispersity and the fine structure of light-scattering characteristics on the quenching effect has been estimated. It is shown that the polydispersity destroys this interference effect only at large widths of particle-size distribution functions. The influence of multiple scattering on this effect is considered in the quasi-crystalline approximation. Multiple scattering results in increasing size parameters and decreasing particle concentration at which coherent transmittance quenching takes place in comparison with the case of single scattering. Our theoretical results for suspensions of latex particles in water are in fairly good agreement with the experimental results.},

This has been demonstrated in the past from extensive theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies of electromagnetic wave scattering by densely packed dielectric spheres. Here, electromagnetic wave scattering by densely packed dielectric spheroids with aligned orientation is studied analytically through quasi-crystalline approximation ({QCA}) and {QCA} with coherent potential ({QCA}-{CP}). We assume that the spheroids are electrically small so that single-particle scattering is simple. Low-frequency {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} solutions are obtained for the average Green’s function and the effective permittivity tensor. For {QCA}-{CP}, the low-frequency expansion of the uniaxial dyadic Green’s function is required. The real parts of the effective permittivities from {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} are compared with the Maxwell–Garnett mixing formula. {QCA} gives results identical to those with the mixing formula, while {QCA}-{CP} gives slightly higher values. The extinction coefficients from {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} are compared with results from Monte Carlo simulations. Both {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} agree well with simulations, although qualitative disagreement is evident at higher fractional volumes.},

The spherical particles are of sizes comparable to wavelength so that Mie scattering is used to describe the single particle scattering characteristics. The coherent wave is studied with quasicrystalline approximation using the cross pair distribution functions of multiple sizes governed by Percus-Yevick approximation. The incoherent scattered wave is calculated with the distorted Born approximation with the result expressed in terms of a product of the T-matrices of particles of different sizes and permittivities and the Fourier transform of the cross pair distribution functions. The coherent wave effective propagation constants, the attenuation rates and the backscattering coefficients are illustrated numerically, with examples chosen to illustrate microwave and millimeter wave scattering from snow cover in the frequency range of 5 {GHz} to 95 {GHz}, and mean grain radius between 0.03 cm to 0.09 cm. Salient features of the numerical results for scattering from snow with size distribution are: 1. Correlated dense medium scattering is less than independent scattering at low frequency, a fact that is consistent with controlled laboratory experiment. 2. Scattering from dense medium of a Rayleigh size distribution with an average radius can be much larger than the case of monodisperse particles of the sizes identical to that average radius. 3. The scattering attenuation rate increases rapidly with frequency at low frequency regime and begins to level off at high frequency regime. 4. The coherent wave scattering attenuation rate is large in snow at frequencies above 15 {GHz} indicating large optical thickness and the importance of multiple scattering. Comparisons with extinction measurements of dry snow at 18 {GHz}, 35 {GHz}, 60 {GHz}, and 90 {GHz} are made.},

	abstract = {A set of radiative wave equations including all four Stokes parameters is derived for vector electromagnetic wave propagation in dense nontenuous media. The derivation is based on the quasi-crystalline approximation with coherent potential on the first moment of the field, and the modified ladder approximation on the second moment of the field. These two approximations are shown to be energetically consistent for dense nontenuous media. To simplify the derivation of the radiative wave equations, the model of small spherical scatterers is used. The derived radiative wave equations assume the same form as the classical radiative transfer equations. However, the relations of the extinction rate, the albedo and the phase matrix to the physical parameters of the media include the effects of dense media and can be different from the classical relations of independent scattering.},

In this paper, two strategies are tested that allow for the elicitation of size information from attenuation spectra when the relevant model parameters are only partially known. The first strategy uses the data on measured sound speed as additional information, which facilitates the fitting of the unknown model parameters parallel to the calculation of the particle size distribution. The second strategy comprises the formation of an empirical model that is based on the principal components, which are obtained by decomposing a measured attenuation spectrum into a set of orthogonal basic spectra. Both strategies are tested with colloidal emulsions: the first one for the cases of unknown particle concentration and unknown specific heat of the droplets, the second one for monitoring changes in the state of dispersion and in the temperature.},

After discussion of three modeling approaches and their implementation into the general {ECAH} framework, and demonstration of their effect on the acoustic field, the behavior of each thus defined model is analyzed as a function of particle concentration. In all cases, convergence to the well-established {ECAH} result is observed in the dilute limit. At high concentrations, particularly good behavior is found for a core−shell (pseudofluid) model, both for suspensions and emulsions. This model correctly predicts an increase of attenuation with particle concentration which is less than linear, in agreement with experimental observations.},

The dispersion equation of the coherent wave inside the slab must be solved numerically. For solid cylinders, there is only one solution corresponding to a mean free path of the coherent wave larger than one wavelength. In that case, the slab region may be described as an effective dissipative fluid medium, and its reflection and transmission coefficients may be formally written as those of a fluid plate. For thin hollow shells, a second solution of the dispersion equation is found, at concentrations large enough for the shells to be coupled via the radiation of a circumferential Scholte–Stoneley A wave on each shell. This occurs at a few resonance frequencies of the shells. At those frequencies, then, two different coherent waves propagate in the slab, and it can no longer be considered a dissipating fluid slab.},

Although novel optical microscopy methods have been developed to probe cellular features beyond the diffraction limit, nanometer-scale quantification remains still inaccessible for in situ tissue. Here we demonstrate that, without actually resolving specific geometrical feature, {OCT} can be sensitive to tissue structural properties at the nanometer length scale. The statistical mass-density distribution in tissue is quantified by its autocorrelation function modeled by the Whittle-Mateŕn functional family. By measuring the wavelength-dependent backscattering coefficient μb(λ) and the scattering coefficient μs, we introduce a technique called inverse spectroscopic {OCT} ({ISOCT}) to quantify the mass-density correlation function. We find that the length scale of sensitivity of {ISOCT} ranges from {\textasciitilde}30 to {\textasciitilde}450 nm. Although these sub-diffractional length scales are below the spatial resolution of {OCT} and therefore not resolvable, they are nonetheless detectable. The sub-diffractional sensitivity is validated by 1) numerical simulations; 2) tissue phantom studies; and 3) ex vivo colon tissue measurements cross-validated by scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}). Finally, the 3D imaging capability of {ISOCT} is demonstrated with ex vivo rat buccal and human colon samples.},

Recently, the synthesis of larger-than-usual {GNRs} ({LGNRs}, ∼ 100 × 30 nm) has been demonstrated. However, {LGNRs} have not been biofunctionalized and therefore remain absent from biomedical literature to date. Here we report the successful biofunctionalization of {LGNRs}, which produces highly stable particles that exhibit a narrow spectral peak ({FWHM} ∼100 nm). We further demonstrated that functionalized {LGNRs} can be used as highly sensitive scattering contrast agents by detecting individual {LGNRs} in clear liquids. Owing to their increased optical cross sections, we found that {LGNRs} exhibited up to 32-fold greater backscattering than conventional {GNRs}. We leveraged these enhanced optical properties to detect {LGNRs} in the vasculature of live tumor-bearing mice. With {LGNR} contrast enhancement, we were able to visualize tumor blood vessels at depths that were otherwise undetectable. We expect that the particles reported herein will enable immediate sensitivity improvements in a wide array of biomedical imaging and sensing techniques that rely on conventional {GNRs}.},

	abstract = {Multiple scattering is a major source that limits light penetration into biotissues, thereby preventing visualization of the deep microstructures for high-resolution optical imaging techniques. The optical clearing approach is a new adventure in biomedical optics for manipulating the optical properties of tissue; for example, the scattering coefficient and the degree of forward scattering of photons, by the use of the chemical administration method in order to improve the optical imaging depth, particularly for the recently developed optical coherence tomography ({OCT}). This paper investigates systematically how the multiple scattering affects signal attenuation and localization in general, and how the alterations of optical properties of tissue enhance the optical imaging depth and signal localization in particular, by the use of Monte Carlo simulations through the separate considerations of the least scattered photons ({LSP}) and multiple scattered photons ({MSP}). The {LSP} are those photons that contribute to the precise {OCT} signal, i.e. localization, and the {MSP} are those that degrade the {OCT} signal. It is shown that with either the reduction of the scattering coefficient or the increase of the degree of forward scattering, signal localization and imaging depth for {OCT} is enhanced. Whilst the increase of the anisotropic factor of the medium is more efficient in improving signal localization, it introduces more scattering events for the photons travelling within the tissue for both the {LSP} and {MSP}. It is also found that the {OCT} imaging resolution is almost reduced exponentially with the increase of the probing depth as opposed to the claimed system resolution. We demonstrate that optical clearing could be a useful tool to improve the imaging resolution when the light progressively penetrates the high scattering medium. Experimental results are also presented to show intuitively how multiple scattering affects {OCT} signal profiles by the use of intralipid solution and healthy human whole blood, representing moderately and highly scattering media respectively.},

Our results are in excellent agreement with dynamic light-scattering size distribution measurements. On consideration of the particle mass conservation as an additional constraint penalty term in the inverse algorithm, it is shown that the quality of the particle size distribution reconstruction can be improved.

	abstract = {The article reviews recent developments in the theory of fluctuations and correlations of energy levels and eigenfunction amplitudes in diffusive mesoscopic samples. Various spatial geometries are considered, with emphasis on low-dimensional (quasi-1D and 2D) systems. Calculations are based on the supermatrix σ-model approach. The method reproduces, in so-called zero-mode approximation, the universal random matrix theory ({RMT}) results for the energy-level and eigenfunction fluctuations. Going beyond this approximation allows us to study system-specific deviations from universality, which are determined by the diffusive classical dynamics in the system. These deviations are especially strong in the far “tails” of the distribution function of the eigenfunction amplitudes (as well as of some related quantities, such as local density of states, relaxation time, etc.). These asymptotic “tails” are governed by anomalously localized states which are formed in rare realizations of the random potential. The deviations of the level and eigenfunction statistics from their {RMT} form strengthen with increasing disorder and become especially pronounced at the Anderson metal–insulator transition. In this regime, the wave functions are multifractal, while the level statistics acquires a scale-independent form with distinct critical features. Fluctuations of the conductance and of the local intensity of a classical wave radiated by a point-like source in the quasi-1D geometry are also studied within the σ-model approach. For a ballistic system with rough surface an appropriately modified (“ballistic”) σ-model is used. Finally, the interplay of the fluctuations and the electron–electron interaction in small samples is discussed, with application to the Coulomb blockade spectra.},

These phenomena are encoded in effective material parameters that can be electronic, magnetic, acoustic, or elastic, and must adequately represent the wave interaction behavior in the composite within desired frequency ranges. In some cases—for example, the low frequency regime—there exist various efficient ways by which effective material parameters for wave propagation in metamaterials may be found. However, the general problem of predicting frequency-dependent dynamic effective constants has remained unsolved. Here, we obtain novel mathematical expressions for the effective parameters of two-dimensional metamaterial systems valid at higher frequencies and wavelengths than previously possible. By way of an example, random configurations of cylindrical scatterers are considered, in various physical contexts: sound waves in a compressible fluid, anti-plane elastic waves, and electromagnetic waves. Our results point towards a paradigm shift in our understanding of these effective properties, and metamaterial designs with functionalities beyond the low-frequency regime are now open for innovation.},

This theory is used to explain phenomena observed in a controlled laboratory experiment. The experimental data indicate that, in a dense medium with small particles, both the coherent attenuation rate and bistatic intensities first increase with the volume fraction of the particles until a maximum is reached, and then decrease when the volume fraction further increases. Thus, attenuation rates and bistatic scattering exhibit a peak as a function of the concentration of particles. The magnitudes of both are also less than those predicted by the independent scattering assumption and the conventional radiative transfer theory. These phenomena cannot be explained by the conventional radiative transfer theory. It is shown that the dense medium radiative transfer theory is in agreement with these experimental features},

The relationship between snow water equivalence ({SWE}) and {SAR} backscattering coefficients at C- and X-band (5.5 and 9.6 {GHz}) can be either positive or negative. Therefore, discovery of the relationship with an empirical approach is unrealistic. Instead, the authors estimate snow depth and particle size using {SIR}-C/X-{SAR} imagery from a physically-based first order backscattering model through analyses of the importance of each scattering term and its sensitivity to snow properties. Using numerically simulated backscattering values, the authors develop semi-empirical models for characterizing the snow-ground interaction terms, the relationships between the ground surface backscattering components, and the snowpack extinction properties at C-band and X-band. With these relationships, snow depth and optical equivalent grain size can be estimated from {SIR}-C/X-{SAR} measurements. Validation using three {SIR}-C/X-{SAR} images shows that the algorithm performs usefully for incidence angles greater than 300, with root mean square errors ({RMSEs}) of 34 cm and 0.27 mm for estimating snow depth and ice optical equivalent particle radius, respectively.},

The Metropolis technique and the sequential random addition of particles methods are used to generate a series of configurations through random processes. The pair distribution functions are calculated by counting the average occurrence of pair separation of particles.

	abstract = {Tree inventories, inter alia, need information on the tree species. Previous studies aimed at distinguishing tree species based on three dimensional tree structure metrics derived from airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) point clouds or based on features from full-waveform ({FW}) laser scanning data provided by today's sensors. Classifications based on {FW} features mainly use echo amplitude, pulse energy (hereafter referred to as energy) and width, which are typically retrieved by waveform decomposition, often performed using the symmetric Gaussian distribution function.
However, for forested areas, the symmetry of the echo shape is potentially modified by multiple scattering and the distribution of scattering elements (e.g. leaves). We assess the potential of processing full-waveform {ALS} data such that the third and fourth statistical moments, i.e. the echo skewness and the echo kurtosis, can be retrieved in addition to the amplitude, energy and {FWHM}. We propose a waveform decomposition approach using the skew normal distribution ({SND}) function, which enables the modelling of skewed echoes. We investigate the difference of tree-crown aggregated {SND} derived {FW} features between seven tree species (969 individual trees) in a temperate mixed forest with the aim of detecting the most descriptive echo features. The such derived {FW} features are tested for species classification.
The results reveal that the largest differences across the tree species are in the mean energy of the first echoes (15 out of 21 species pairs show differences), followed by the mean amplitude of the first echoes and the mean skewness of all echoes originating from a single crown (14 out of 21 species pairs show differences against each other for both features).
The differentiation of coniferous and deciduous trees benefits from the features derived from the {SND} decomposition compared to the use of echo amplitude only (0.39 vs. 0.61 in Cohen's κ). As the classification accuracy of the three dominant tree species within the test site only shows a small increase (0.20 vs. 0.26 in Cohen's κ) by adding {FW} features, we propose the use of such features in combination with features from multispectral data for this purpose.
The {SND} decomposition is comparable to the Gaussian decomposition regarding the decomposition accuracy ({RMSE} = 4.45 vs. {RMSE} = 3.50) and computational cost. Hence, we propose the default use of the {SND} decomposition, as the {SND} is a more flexible function, allowing for the modelling of normally distributed echoes, as well as the fitting of skewed echoes, while no limitations regarding the direction of the skewness are introduced. We attribute the difficulties in the tree species classification to the relatively wide ranges of the crown aggregated features within one species, which for some features results in a considerable overlap of the feature ranges across the species.},

The scattering calculations have been carried out with Waterman’s T-matrix approach, as developed recently by Mishchenko [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 8, 871 (1991); Appl. Opt. 32, 4562 (1993)]. Our main interest is in light scattering by polydisperse models of nonspherical particles because averaging over sizes provides more realistic modeling of natural ensembles of scattering particles and washes out the interference structure and ripple typical of monodisperse scattering patterns, thus enabling us to derive meaningful conclusions about the effects of particle nonsphericity on light scattering. Following Hansen and Travis [Space Sci. Rev. 16, 527 (1974)], we show that scattering properties of most physically plausible size distributions of randomly oriented nonspherical particles depend primarily on the effective equivalent-sphere radius and effective variance of the distribution, the actual shape of the distribution having a minor influence. To minimize the computational burden, we have adopted a computationally convenient power law distribution of particle equivalent-sphere radii n(r) ∝ r−3, r1 ≤ r ≤ r2. The effective variance of the size distribution is fixed at 0.1, and the effective size parameter continuously varies from 0 to 15. We present results of computer calculations for 24 prolate and oblate spheroidal shapes with aspect ratios from 1.1 to 2.2. The elements of the scattering matrix for the whole range of size parameters and scattering angles are displayed in the form of contour plots. Computational results are compared with analogous calculations for surface-equivalent spheres, and the effects of particle shape on light scattering are discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {The problem of finding the ensemble averaged Green's function ⟨G⟩ which describes an electron moving in the potential field of N stationary scatterers is formulated in terms of multiple scattering theory. The correlations between the positions of the scatterers are explicitly taken into account. By making use of the quasicrystalline approximation and a generalization of the coherent-potential prescription, a procedure for calculating ⟨G⟩ is proposed. Because of the use of the quasicrystalline approximation, it involves only the radial distribution function of the scatterers in addition to the scatterer-electron interaction potential. It is shown that the procedure reduces to the coherent-potential approximation for randomly distributed scatterers, i.e., no short-range order, and to Korringa's band-structure calculation for an order lattice. It is pointed out that the method is applicable to the problem of electronic states in random alloys and that of vibrational spectra of imperfect crystals.},

Problems of this kind are often solved by regarding the effects of the inhomogeneity as an unknown source term driving a Helmholtz equation, leading to an equation of Lippmann--Schwinger type. It is shown that this approach is incomplete when the density is discontinuous. Analogous scattering problems for elastic waves and for electromagnetic waves are also discussed briefly.},

The comparison body will usually be taken as homogeneous and elastic in applications but, at least formally, there is no bar to its being inhomogeneous, viscoelastic and non-local. The novel feature of the formulation is the introduction of a “momentum polarization” to cope with density variations in a way that exactly parallels the stress polarization's correspondence with variations in moduli. To illustrate the use of the equations, scattering by an ellipsoidal inhomogeneity in a generally anisotropic matrix is studied in the Rayleigh limit and an asymptotic formula for its scattering cross-section is given. Detailed results are presented for a spheroidal inhomogeneity in an isotropic matrix, with explicit limiting forms for the scattering cross-sections of penny-shaped cracks, rigid circular discs and rigid needles.},

Ultrasonic velocities considered longitudinal and transverse waves and modulus of elasticity and modulus of shear were determined by correlations between them. In carbon steels, a lower value of ultrasonic velocity was observed for the martensite in relation to the other microstructures, while the opposite was observed in terms of ultrasonic attenuation. The results show that the use of ultrasonic measurements to obtain ultrasonic velocities and attenuations, in order to correlate them with the involved microstructures, as well as to determine the modulus of elasticity and modulus of shear, is very fast and reliable, permitting the characterization of nondestructive microstructural and elastic properties.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of 5 {MHz} ultrasound backscattered at the Rayleigh angle from waterimmersed specimens of En3A, En9 and En25 steel has been related to microstructural features induced by heat treatment. The range of phase structures considered is a substantial extension on what has been described in the previous literature. In the case of the En25 samples, which all had the same mean grain size, the backscattered energy decreased systematically with increasing hardness, within the standard deviation of the energy backscattered from different regions of the same sample. When all samples of the three types of steel were compared at constant grain size in the Rayleigh scattering region, the backscattered energy was found to vary systematically with phase structure in the decreasing sequence: 80\% pearlite-20\% ferrite {\textgreater} bainite {\textgreater} tempered martensite {\textgreater} 80\%ferrite-20\%pearlite {\textgreater} acicular ferrite {\textgreater} martensite. The intensity of backscattering can be changed by up to 20 {dB} by heat treatment, with a standard deviation of ∼ 1.5 {dB} for repeat measurements at the same sample point, while the standard deviation for thesignal intensity arising from different regions of the same specimen surface varied between 2 and 4 {dB}. It appears that the backscatter technique can readily distinguish between different phase structures as produced, for example, by oven cooling and air cooling, and it is worth noting that the data were obtained using a standard, relatively inexpensive, ultrasonic flaw detector.},

By taking into proper account the singularity of the dyadic Green's function in the renormalization method, the low-frequency limit of vector electromagnetic wave scattering from a random medium with large variance of permittivity function is studied. The strong fluctuation random theory is then applied to a ‘discrete scatterer’ problem in which the permittivity can assume only two values. It is then shown that the results of the strong fluctuation theory are consistent with those derived from discrete scatterer theory for all values of dielectric constants of the scatterers. Numerical results of the effective permittivity are illustrated for random media with isotropic and anisotropic correlation functions. It is shown that the results of the weak fluctuations theory differ significantly from those of the strong fluctuation theory. The second moment of the field in the backscattering direction is calculated using the distorted Born approximation and illustrated using parameters typically encountered in microwave remote sensing of vegetation.},

These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between localized sites. In this simple model the essential randomness is introduced by requiring the energy to vary randomly from site to site. It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.},

To a first approximation the transport of the multiple scattered waves is given by diffusion theory, but important corrections are presented. These corrections are calculated with the radiative transfer or Schwarzschild-Milne equation, which describes intensity transport at the “mesoscopic” level and is derived from the “microscopic” wave equation. A precise treatment of the diffuse intensity is derived which automatically includes the effects of boundary layers. Effects such as the enhanced backscatter cone and imaging of objects in opaque media are also discussed within this framework. This approach is extended to mesoscopic correlations between multiple scattered intensities that arise when scattering is strong. These correlations arise from the underlying wave character. The derivation of correlation functions and intensity distribution functions is given and experimental data are discussed. Although the focus is on light scattering, the theory is also applicable to microwaves, sound waves, and noninteracting electrons.},

The new model is based on a development by Luppé, Conoir, and Norris (2012) which accounts for the effects of multiple mode conversions between thermal, shear and compressional modes. The model is here applied to the case of oil in water emulsions in which thermal effects are dominant. The additional contributions are expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for conversion between compressional and thermal modes and vice versa. These terms are due to the effect of thermal waves produced at one particle being reconverted into the compressional mode at neighboring particles. The effects are demonstrated by numerical simulations for a sunflower oil in water emulsion which show that the additional terms are significant at low frequency and high concentrations. Comparison is also made with experimental data for a hexadecane in water emulsion. Although qualitative agreement is demonstrated, there are some quantitative differences, which are attributed to uncertainties in the physical properties, in the experimental data, or in the assumptions made in the model.},

Our observations of polar regions have evolved from happenstance ship sightings and isolated harbor icing records to routine global records obtained by those satellites.

This explosion of information about sea ice has fascinated scientists for some 20 years.

	abstract = {In this paper, we use a 2-D elastodynamic boundary integral equation or boundary element method ({BEM}) to solve multiple scattering problems due to existence of cracks or inclusions. The method is based on the integral representation of a scattered wavefield by assuming a fictitious source distribution on the scattering objects or inclusions (i.e. mathematical description of Huygens' principle), and the fictitious source distribution can be found by matching appropriate boundary conditions at the boundary of the inclusions. The method is called indirect boundary element method. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the versatility of the {BEM} method. The first example shows that different spatial arrangements of the same scatters lead to profound differences in scattering characteristics, in particular the frequency contents of the transmitted wavefields using the method of time-frequency analysis. The second example shows the effects of power-law or fractal distribution of scalelengths on transmitted wavefields, and we conclude that frequency characteristics, such as the frequency of the peak attenuation, can be related to spatial size parameters of the model. In the third example, we show that orientated inclusions with aspect ratio less than unity have strong effects on the amplitudes of transmitted waves, and this has an important implication in characterizing inclusions and fractures using azimuthal variation in amplitudes (or attenuation anisotropy).},

	abstract = {Ultrasound contrast agents ({UCA}), such as microbubbles, enhance the scattering properties of blood, which is otherwise hypoechoic. The multiple scattering interactions of the acoustic field with {UCA} are poorly understood due to the complexity of the multiple scattering theories and the nonlinear microbubble response. The majority of bubble models describe the behavior of {UCA} as single, isolated microbubbles suspended in infinite medium. Multiple scattering models such as the independent scattering approximation can approximate phase velocity and attenuation for low scatterer volume fractions. However, all current models and simulation approaches only describe multiple scattering and nonlinear bubble dynamics separately. Here we present an approach that combines two existing models: (1) a full-wave model that describes nonlinear propagation and scattering interactions in a heterogeneous attenuating medium and (2) a Paul–Sarkar model that describes the nonlinear interactions between an acoustic field and microbubbles. These two models were solved numerically and combined with an iterative approach. The convergence of this combined model was explored in silico for 0.5 × 10 6 microbubbles ml −1 , 1\% and 2\% bubble concentration by volume. The backscattering predicted by our modeling approach was verified experimentally with water tank measurements performed with a 128-element linear array transducer. An excellent agreement in terms of the fundamental and harmonic acoustic fields is shown. Additionally, our model correctly predicts the phase velocity and attenuation measured using through transmission and predicted by the independent scattering approximation.},

These contributions account for the apparent stretching of the lidar return within optically thick media. Using a Monte Carlo approach, the specific roles of cloud optical properties and instrument geometries in determining the magnitude of pulse stretching are examined. Multiple scattering contributions were found to be significant for lidars operating on the space platform, and pulse stretching of the order of that observed in {LITE} was reproduced over a wide range of cloud optical parameters. This study seeks to both identify and quantify lidar pulse stretching in terms of these driving parameters.},

In this paper we consider a distributed field of weak microscatterers, like aerosols in the atmosphere, which coexists with microstructured clutter in the medium, like the fluctuations of the index of refraction of the turbulent  atmosphere. We analyze the Wigner transform or the angularly resolved intensity profile of the backscattered wave when the incident wave is a beam in the paraxial regime and when the Born approximation is valid for the microscatterers. An enhanced backscattering phenomenon is proved, and the properties of the enhanced backscattering cone (relative amplitude and profile) are shown to depend on the statistical parameters of the microstructure but not on the microscatterers. These results are based on a multiscale analysis of the fourth-order moment of the fundamental solution of the white-noise paraxial wave equation. They pave the way for an estimation method of the statistical parameters of the microstructure from the observation of the enhanced backscattering cone. In our scaling argument we differentiate the two important canonical scaling regimes, which are the scintillation regime and the spot dancing regime.},

This study generalizes the basic formulation in terms of Itô–Schrödinger equations in a one-dimensional deterministic background, describing the macrostructure, to one in which the background is more complicated. It provides the first step toward the analysis of scattered waves in general background media modulated by a random microstructure. We discuss in detail the enhanced backscattering phenomenon or weak localization in this setting, with a tilted interface imbedded in the random medium, and find that the backscattering cone does not depend on the tilt.

Here, we discuss recent developments in imaging that aim at exploiting as data incoherent noisy signals that are not associated with well-defined arrival times. Indeed, signal constituents that in a classical setting may be regarded as noise may contain important information about the medium to be imaged. We show how it is possible to use the statistics of such noisy signals, specifically, the second-order statistics, for imaging. We consider two particular situations: first, the estimation of an (“empirical”) Green's function from noisy signals which can subsequently be used in imaging; second, the localization of a cluster of random sources from noisy signals (passive imaging). The analysis presented here is based on assuming a remote sensing scaling and the paraxial approximation, and it uses in part the results set forth in Papanicolaou, Ryzhik, and Solna [{SIAM} J. Appl. Math., 64 (2004), pp. 1133–1155] that relate to time-reversal, statistical stability, and superresolution. Robustness with respect to modeling assumptions is illustrated by considering other scaling regimes also. We demonstrate how the estimation problem and its robustness can be considered as a dual to that of time-reversal and stable superresolution. We obtain a novel analysis and foundation for the use of ambient seismic noise in body-wave (tomographic) imaging, motivated by the recent successes of surface-wave tomography using ambient seismic noise.},

In addition, we discuss a general theory based on a diffusion approximation, and the resulting angular-dependent enhanced backscattering intensity will be presented in closed form for finite slabs and for general albedo. New transmission and reflection experiments for strongly scattering media are presented. Two types of liquid suspensions have been used as study object: polystyrene spheres in water and suspensions of {TiO}2 particles in 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol. From these experiments scattering mean free paths and transport mean free paths have been obtained. Relative values for the transport mean free paths could also independently be inferred from the observation of the angular dependence of enhanced (interference) backscattering. The observed shapes and widths of the enhanced backscattering cones are in very good agreement with the calculated values. A less satisfying feature is that the theory predicts a backscattering intensity of twice the background intensity, while the experimental value is some 15–20 \% lower.},

	abstract = {A fundamental quantity in multiple scattering is the transport mean free path whose inverse describes the scattering strength of a sample. In this letter, we emphasize the importance of an appropriate description of the effective refractive index \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ in multiple light scattering to accurately describe the light transport in dense photonic glasses. Using \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ as calculated by the Energy Coherent Potential Approximation we are able to predict the transport mean free path of monodisperse photonic glass. This model without any fit parameter is in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations and in quantitative agreement with spectrally resolved coherent backscattering measurements on new specially synthesized polystyrene photonic glasses. These materials exhibit resonant light scattering perturbed by strong near field coupling, all captured within the model. Our model might be used to maximize the scattering strength of high index photonic glasses, which are a key in the search for Anderson Localization of light in 3D.},

The light flux received at a detector from a laser is typically assumed to be only singly scattered out of the beam, with no possibility for the multiple scattering of photons initially scattered in other directions back into the detector’s field of view. We present the results of a new simulation for the scattering of light from a vertically-directed laser beam, and derive a parametrization for the multiple scattered signal expected at a detector from such a source as a function of the prevailing atmospheric conditions. The parametrization is then used to estimate the increase in the reconstructed height-dependent aerosol loading when recovered using a laser-based technique.},

	abstract = {A technique is developed for measurement of bubble, droplet and particle-size distributions in multiphase systems, based on the propagation speed and attenuation of ultrasound. The measurement of the size distribution of the dispersed phase in multiphase systems was desired to analyze the mass-transfer mechanism in gas-liquid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid systems. To obtain this information, both the ultrasonic velocity and the attenuation coefficient of tone-burst signals are determined for a large frequency range (typically 100 {kHz} – 100 {MHz}). From these parameters, the size distributions and the volume fraction of the different dispersed phases can be determined using a scattering model. It was shown that the interfacial area can be determined very accurately, however, for the exact size distribution of the gas bubbles in the used size range (1–3 mm) an independent gas holdup determination is required. Experiments were performed in gas-liquid, solid-liquid, and gas-liquid-solid systems. The results showed good agreement of the particle-size distribution compared to a commercial laser-scattering analyzer, both with and without gas bubbles present. Furthermore, a good agreement between the scattering model and the experiments was found in the systems that contained gas bubbles, but these results should be validated using for instance, a digital camera technique. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 50: 2750–2762, 2004},

These conventional methods are useful for the void fraction around 10-6 or lower. However, the change of compressibility in the bubbly water also should be considered in bubble sizing for the void fraction around 10-5 or higher. Recently the sound speed as well as sound attenuation was considered for acoustic bubble size estimation in bubbly water. In this paper, the sound speed estimated from sound attenuation in bubbly water by an iterative method is used for a bubble counting. This new iterative inverse bubble sizing technique is numerically tested for bubble distributions of single-size Gaussian, and power-law functions. The numerical simulation results are in agreement with the given bubble distributions even for the high void fractions of 10-4-10-3. It suggests that the iterative inverse technique can be a very powerful tool for practical use in acoustic bubble counting in the ocean},

	abstract = {The most popular technique for estimating the gas bubble size distribution ({BSD}) in liquids is through the inversion of measured attenuation and/or sound speed of a travelling wave. The model inherent in such inversions never exactly matches the conditions of the measurement, and the size of the resulting error (which could well be small in quasi-free field conditions) cannot be quantified if only a free field code exists. Users may be unaware of errors because, with sufficient regularization, such inversions can always be made to produce an answer, the accuracy of which is unknown unless independent (e.g. optical) measurements are made. This study was commissioned to assess the size of this error for the mercury-filled steel pipelines of the target test facility ({TTF}) of the spallation neutron source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, {TN}, {USA}. Large errors in estimating the {BSD} (greater than 1000\% overcounts/undercounts) are predicted. A new inversion technique appropriate for pipelines such as {TTF} gives good {BSD} estimations if the frequency range is sufficiently broad. However, it also shows that implementation of the planned reduction in frequency bandwidth for the {TTF} bubble sensor would make even this inversion insufficient to obtain an accurate {BSD} in {TTF}.},

We may wish to characterize the effects of clouds or water droplets along the line of sight between an airplane and a radar installation, or we may be interested in using radar to probe the random medium itself, such as in determining snow depth and particle size. In all of these problems it is necessary to predict the propagation constant in the “random” medium. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the accuracy of the quasi-crystalline approximation and other associated methods of determining the effective permittivity for two-dimensional (2-D) random media. A numerical method based on the method of moments is used as a gauge for comparison with the theoretical methods. After deriving the 2-D quasi-crystalline approximation and presenting the numerical method, the behavior of the effective permittivity is analyzed for a range of particle sizes, volume fractions and dielectric losses. From this analysis, regions of validity for the theoretical methods are determined. An investigation is also given which explores the effect of particle arrangement methods on the pair distribution function which, in turn, is shown to have a significant effect on the imaginary component of the effective permittivity},

The electromagnetic fields are calculated by Numerical Solutions of 3D Maxwell Equations ({NMM}3D) using the method of Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations combined with method of the body of revolution ({BOR}). Using the calculated transmission, we derive, the “tau”, the optical thickness, which describes the magnitude of the transmission. Two cases are considered: the short cylinders case and the extended-cylinders case. The case of short cylinders is that the lengths of cylinders are much smaller than the layer thickness, while the case of extended cylinders is that the lengths of the cylinders are the same as or comparable to the layer thickness. Numerical results are illustrated for plane vertical polarized waves obliquely incident on the layer of cylinders. The {NMM}3D results for the extended-cylinders case show large differences of transmission from the results of approaches such as effective permittivity ({EP}), the distorted Born approximation ({DBA}), and the radiative transfer equation ({RTE}).

	abstract = {The numerous approaches used in micromechanics can be classified into four broad categories: perturbation methods, self-consistent methods of truncation of a hierarchy, variational methods, and the model methods. In detail we will consider the self-consistent methods applied to linear elastic problems, based on some approximate and closing assumptions for truncating of an infinite system of integral equations involved and their approximate solution. We consider multiparticle effective field methods, effective medium methods, the Mori-Tanaka method, differential methods and some others. This review article tends to concentrate on methods and concepts, their possible generalizations, and connections of different methods, rather than explicit results. In the framework of a unique scheme, we undertake an attempt to analyze the wide class of statical and dynamical, local and nonlocal, linear and nonlinear micromechanical problems of composite materials with deterministic (periodic and non-periodic) and random (statistically homogeneous and inhomogeneous, so-called graded) structures, containing coated or uncoated inclusions of any shape and orientation and subjected to coupled or uncoupled, homogeneous or inhomogeneous, external fields of different physical natures. The last section contains a discussion of prospects for future work. The article includes 540 references.},

This phenomenon, which is referred to as scattering of the electromagnetic wave, explains why the sky is blue. While nonionizing electromagnetic waves such as visible light and infrared radiation mainly undergo elastic scattering (in which the wavelength of the scattered radiation does not change), scattered ionizing radiations undergo a change in wavelength (inelastic scattering). Both types of scattering may have a role in the daily practice of anesthesia and intensive care medicine. For example, the elastic scattering of infrared radiation is one of the principles on which near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS}) cerebral oximetry is based and, at the same time, represents a major technological challenge which accounts for some limitations of this technique. Moreover, the special kind of (inelastic) scattering which ionizing radiations undergo (Compton scattering) has a key role in radiation protection. Finally, although nonionizing electromagnetic waves mainly undergo elastic scattering, inelastic scattering may also occur: this phenomenon, which is known as Raman scattering, is used in some types of respiratory gas analyzers.},

Our exact results illustrate and substantiate the methodology underlying the microphysical theories of radiative transfer and coherent backscattering.

This work addresses these problems by adapting and testing a technique for measuring the absolute attenuation and the absolute backscatter coefficient (effective backscatter cross section per unit volume of material), as a function of frequency, in a single-transducer backscatter configuration. The frequency-dependent attenuation and backscatter coefficients of a tissue-mimicking gelatin phantom containing a random distribution of two populations of scatterers were measured, Three transducers with different center frequencies and focusing characteristics were used in order to verify that system-dependent effects were removed by the technique and to investigate the change in the measured parameters across a broad range of frequencies (2 to 60 {MHz}). A spherical autocorrelation model was applied to measurements of the backscatter coefficient in order to estimate the size of scatterers. Measurements demonstrate that the backscatter and attenuation properties of a mixture of two distinct intermixed scatterer-size populations change as a function of the frequency range across which the model is applied. Comparison of both the magnitude and the frequency dependence of the experimental results with the theoretical prediction of the backscatter coefficient showed good agreement.},

	abstract = {A multiple scattering analysis in a non-viscous fluid is developed in order to predict the effective constitutive parameters of certain suspensions of disordered particles or bubbles. The analysis is based on an effective field approach, and uses suitable pair-correlation functions to account for the essential features of densely distributed particles. The effective medium that is equivalent to the original suspension of particles is a medium with space and time dispersion, and hence, its parameters are functions of the frequency of the incident acoustic wave. Under the quasi-crystalline approximation, novel expressions are presented for effective constitutive parameters, which are valid at any frequency and wavelength. The emerging possibility of designing fluid–particle mixtures to form acoustic metamaterials is discussed. Our theory provides a convenient tool for testing ideas in silico in the search for new metamaterials with specific desired properties. An important conclusion of the proposed approach is that negative constitutive parameters can also be achieved by using suspensions of particles with random microstructures with properties similar to those shown in periodic arrays of microstructures.},

	abstract = {The acoustic field reflected from a region containing spherical scatterers is most often estimated by use of the coherent field; that is, the field resulting from the summed scattered fields from the scatterers, averaged over all possible configurations of scatterer locations. It is this ensemble-averaged coherent field which is equivalent to the field reflected from a homogeneous medium with properties which can be derived mathematically using ensemble-averaging techniques. Such properties include the effective density, and the effective wavenumber, which can be derived from multiple scattering theories, or by other homogenisation methods. Experimentally, although ensemble-averaging can be effected in practice in fluid systems due to the motion of the scatterers during the measurement time-scale, measurements in solid materials have fixed locations of scatterers. Averaging can only be achieved by using "large" sample areas, multiple samples or measurements in different locations, or "large" receiver areas. However, in the context of {NDE} applications we are interested in the field resulting from a specific region of material, rather than the average over a large region. Our study addresses the question of when the coherent field (resulting from averaging over many scatterer configurations) can be used as an accurate description of the field reflected by a region of scatterers at fixed locations. In this paper we present results of simulations of the scattered reflected field from a region of solid material containing spherical cavities. Simulations of single realisations of scatterer locations are compared with the coherent field, to demonstrate the validity or otherwise of the use of the coherent field to describe the response of a particular configuration of scatterers.},

To understand the phenomena, a multiple scattering theory, valid for all frequencies, has been developed for scalar {SH} waves reflected by an infinitely large number of uni-directional fibres enclosed in a slab region of an infinitely large body of matrix material. In view of the randomness in position of the fibres in a cross-section, the theory, correct to the order ofc2, wherecis the concentration of the fibres, ignores correlation in the positions of the fibres. Both coherent and incoherent scatterings are considered. A numerical example shows that resonance phenomena begin to appear at about the order of 0.1 {MHz}.},

A quantitative description of the size of these inclusions is critical for both interpreting and modeling the electromagnetic properties of sea ice. Photomicrographs of ice thin sections were analyzed using a personal computer-based image-processing system to determine the number of inclusions, the inclusion size distributions, and statistics for brine pockets in young ice and first-year ice and for air bubbles in a multiyear hummock. Inclusions ranging in size from thousandths of square millimeters to a few square millimeters were measured. In all cases a two-parameter lognormal distribution fits the cumulative inclusion size distributions well (correlation coefficient greater than 0.99). This includes brine pockets in both granular and columnar ice and a range of brine volumes from 2\% to 40\%. As ice warms, and its brine volume increases, the size distribution shifts toward larger brine pockets. This increase in brine pocket size is particularly pronounced for brine volumes greater than 10\% as individual brine pockets coalesce. Air bubbles are much larger than brine pockets, with mean major axis lengths of the order of millimeters for air bubbles and tenths of a millimeter for brine pockets. Observations of inclusion shape factors indicate that, in general, brine pockets are more elongated than air bubbles.},

	abstract = {Dense media radiative transfer ({DMRT}) equations based on quasicrystalline approximation ({QCA}) for densely distributed moderate size particles are developed. We first compute the effective propagation constant and coherent transmission into a dense medium on the basis of the generalized Lorentz-Lorenz law and the generalized Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem. The absorption coefficient of the dense media is then calculated. The distorted Born approximation is next applied to a thin layer to determine the bistatic scattering coefficients and the scattering coefficient. The phase matrix in {DMRT} is then obtained as bistatic scattering coefficient per unit volume. The model is applied to multiple sizes and for sticky particles. Numerical results are illustrated for extinction and brightness temperatures in passive remote sensing using typical parameters in snow terrain. The {QCA}-based {DMRT} is also used to compare with satellite Special Sensor Microwave Imager ({SSM}/I) brightness temperatures for four channels at 19 and 37 {GHz} with vertical and horizontal polarizations and for two snow seasons. It shows reasonable agreement to snow depth of 1 m.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic models can be used for understanding the interaction between electromagnetic waves and matter, interpreting experimental data, and retrieving geophysical parameters. Comparing the results of different snow models, when driven with the same set of input parameters, can benefit remote sensing of snow. Microwave brightness temperatures of snow at 19 and 37 {GHz} for six different classes of snow (prairie, tundra, taiga, alpine, maritime, and ephemeral) are simulated by means of four different electromagnetic models: the Helsinki University of Technology snow emission model, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks, a dense-medium radiative-transfer theory model, and a strong fluctuation theory model. The frequency behavior of the extinction coefficients obtained with the different models between 5 and 90 {GHz} is also studied. The four models are also driven with inputs derived from snow-pit data, and the outputs are compared with ground-based measurements of brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 36.5 {GHz}. Significant differences among the brightness temperatures and the extinction coefficients simulated with the four models in the cases of the six classes of snow are observed. Moreover, no particular model is found to be able to systematically reproduce all of the experimental data. The results highlight the need to more closely examine the relationships relating mean grain size and correlation length, introduce multiple layers in each model, and to perform controlled laboratory measurements on materials with well-known electromagnetic properties in order to improve the understanding of the causes of the observed differences and to improve model performance},

	abstract = {For several decades the propagation characteristics of acoustic pulses (attenuation and sound speed) have been inverted in attempts to measure the size distributions of gas bubbles in liquids. While this has biomedical and industrial applications, most notably it has been attempted in the ocean for defence and environmental purposes, where the bubbles are predominantly generated by breaking waves. Such inversions have required assumptions, and the state–of–the–art technique still assumes that the bubbles undergo linear, steady–state monochromatic pulsations in the free field, without interacting. The measurements always violate, to a greater or lesser extent, these assumptions. The errors incurred by the use of such assumptions have been difficult to quantify, but are expected to be most severe underneath breakers in the surf zone, where the void fraction is greatest. Very few measurements have been made in this important region of the ocean. This paper provides a method by which attenuation can be predicted through clouds of bubbles which need not be homogeneous, nor restricted to linear steady–state monochromatic pulsations. To allow inversion of measured surf zone attenuations to estimate bubble populations with current computational facilities, this model is simplified such that the bubble cloud is assumed to be homogeneous and the bubbles oscillating in steady state (although still nonlinearly). The uses of the new methods for assessing the errors introduced in using state–of–the–art inversions are discussed, as are their implications for oceanographic and industrial nonlinear bubble counters, for biomedical contrast agents, and for sonar target detection in the surf zone.},

	shorttitle = {Coherent acoustic response of a screen containing a random distribution of scatterers},
	abstract = {Theoretical models underlying the ultrasonic study of suspensions and bubble swarms in liquids often rely on the concept of a coherent wave response, within which the given medium is viewed as an effective homogeneous medium. More specifically, the coherent response can be formulated in a straightforward manner via the effective wave number and the effective impedance. These in turn can be expressed through the actual material properties of the given scattering medium. The derivation of the effective wave number and impedance is the issue of a number of different approaches existing in the multiple-scattering theory. The present work deals with a coherent response of acoustic wave impinging on a screen of cylindrical inclusions randomly distributed in a fluid. The reflection and transmission coefficients have been expressed via the effective wave number and impedance that are provided by three different models due to Foldy, Waterman \& Truell, and Linton \& Martin. The obtained expressions have been analyzed with a view to illuminate what is the quantitative difference between those approaches as revealed in the coherent response, and how this difference depends on the basic parameters of the problem such as the frequency, the concentration of scatterers and their contrast relatively to the fluid matrix. Another aspect of this work is to compare the above analytical results with the numerical data. It has been obtained by means of a deterministic computational code which delivers the coherent wave field through averaging the outputs for various samplings of the positions of scatterers. Knowing this numerical benchmark allows us to specify the validity domains for each of the three analytical methods under study.},

Both emulsions (containing liquid oil droplets) and suspensions (containing crystallized oil particles) have been studied. The suspensions were prepared by crystallizing octadecane droplets in the emulsion. Then, by using a supercooling effect, measurements were obtained at 20°C with either liquid or solid particles. The particle concentrations were 5 and 4.3\% v/v for the emulsions and suspensions, respectively, and the particles had diameters in the range 0.2–30 μm. Measurements were made of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation in the frequency range 5–96 {MHz}. The results are compared with theoretical predictions using a first-order multiple scattering formalism, including polydispersity in particle size. There are dramatic effects, both theoretically and experimentally, upon freezing the particles, mainly due to the presence of resonances in the suspension. In this system the largest particles in the distribution are those most likely to be undergoing resonance. Thus the ultrasonic properties are highly dependent on the detailed particle size distribution.},

The central portion of the review concerns methods for calculating the averaged Green's function to successively better approximation, including various self-consistent methods, and higher-order cluster effects.

As a first step, we present a theoretical description of {OCT} speckle, relating the {OCT} amplitude variance to size and organization for samples of discrete random media ({DRM}). Starting the calculations from the size and organization of the scattering particles, we analytically find expressions for the {OCT} amplitude mean, amplitude variance, the backscattering coefficient and the scattering coefficient. We assume fully developed speckle and verify the validity of this assumption by experiments on controlled samples of silica microspheres suspended in water. We show that the {OCT} amplitude variance is sensitive to sub-resolution changes in size and organization of the scattering particles.

Coda wave interferometry is a technique wherein changes in multiple-scattered waves are used as a diagnostic for minute changes in the medium. This technique was developed previously for scalar waves; however, the application of this technique in geophysics, nondestructive testing, and other applications where elastic waves are used, requires the extension of the existing formulation of coda wave interferometry to include conversions between P and S waves. Here, a simple model for the equilibration between P and S waves incorporates into the theory of coda wave interferometry the mode conversions that are inherent to multiply scattered elastic waves.},

After tracing the fundamental link between radiative transfer theory and the effect of coherent backscattering, the authors explain them in the context of a comprehensive hierarchy of electromagnetic scattering problems. Dedicated sections present a thorough discussion of the physical meaning and range of applicability of the radiative transfer equation and compare the self-consistent microphysical and the traditional phenomenological approaches to radiative transfer. This self-contained book will be valuable for science professionals, engineers, and graduate students working across a wide range of disciplines including optics, electromagnetics, remote sensing, atmospheric radiation, astrophysics, and biomedicine.},

Coda wave interferometry is a technique that exploits this sensitivity to estimate slight changes in the medium from a comparison of the coda waves before and after the perturbation. For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location.},

	abstract = {Acoustic backscatter using a single-frequency transducer can be used for field measurement of irregularly shaped, suspended sediment with a given size distribution. It is assumed that the size distribution of the suspended sediment does not change significantly along the sound path. A newly found explicit solution to acoustic backscatter equation is derived. This explicit solution reduces the computation time significantly during the inversion process. The near-field effect can be included in the inverted quantities by calculating the initial condition with the far-field acoustic backscatter equation and under the assumption of uniform near-field concentration. This method proved successful in the laboratory with initial concentrations of sand up to 3.5 g/L. The errors in estimation of concentration that result from errors in the attenuation coefficients or near-field concentration are significantly amplified with range in a uniform concentration field. However, with an exponential concentration profile, which is commonly found in sediment suspension phenomena, the inversion is only weakly sensitive to attenuation coefficients associated with sound absorption by water and sound scattering by suspended particles. Near-field concentration errors result in commensurate errors throughout the range in the exponential profile.},

The latter is a solver based on numerical Monte Carlo integration of the ladder and cyclical diagrams appearing in the microphysical theory of radiative transfer and coherent backscattering ({RT}-{CB}). The quantitative agreement between the {STMM} and {RT}-{CB} computations provides verification of the {RT}-{CB} theory. Prominent backscattering features exhibited by the {STMM} data cannot be reproduced by keeping only the ladder diagrams of {RT}. Our results strongly support the {CB} explanation of opposition brightness and polarization phenomena observed for a class of atmosphereless solar-system objects.

The results show that, with a proper correction for the confocal properties of the sample arm, both models are appropriate to extract the scattering coefficients of weakly scattering media. For highly scattering media, the multiple scattering should be taken into account, and the multiple-scattering model can provide higher accuracy.

Many factors are considered including the effects of scatterer size, interference between the fields scattered from closely adjacent scatterers, and the numerical aperture of the {OCT} system. The modulation of the spectrum of the incident light by scattering of a plane wave from a single sphere is a good indicator of particle size and composition. However, it is shown in this work that the sharp focusing of fields causes the spectral signature to shift and the presence of multiple scatterers has dramatic modulation effects on the spectra.

	abstract = {We discuss the theoretical basis of a recently developed technique to characterize aerosols from space. We show that the interaction between aerosols and the strong molecular scattering in the near ultraviolet produces spectral variations of the backscattered radiances that can be used to separate aerosol absorption from scattering effects. This capability allows identification of several aerosol types, ranging from nonabsorbing sulfates to highly {UV}-absorbing mineral dust, over both land and water surfaces. Two ways of using the information contained in the near-{UV} radiances are discussed. In the first method, a residual quantity, which measures the departure of the observed spectral contrast from that of a molecular atmosphere, is computed. Since clouds yield nearly zero residues, this method is a useful way of separately mapping the spatial distribution of {UV}-absorbing and nonabsorbing particles. To convert the residue to optical depth, the aerosol type must be known. The second method is an inversion procedure that uses forward calculations of backscattered radiances for an ensemble of aerosol models. Using a look-up table approach, a set of measurements given by the ratio of backscattered radiance at 340–380 nm and the 380 nm radiance are associated, within the domain of the candidate aerosol models, to values of optical depth and single-scattering albedo. No previous knowledge of aerosol type is required. We present a sensitivity analysis of various error sources contributing to the estimation of aerosol properties by the two methods.},

	abstract = {For more than a century the possibility of imaging the structure of a medium with diffracting wave fields has been limited by the tradeoff between resolution and imaging depth. While long wavelengths can penetrate deep into a medium, the resolution limit precludes the possibility of observing subwavelength structures. Near-field microscopy has recently demonstrated that the resolution limit can be overcome by bringing a probing sensor within one wavelength distance from the surface to be imaged. This paper extends the scope of near-field microscopy to the reconstruction of subwavelength structures from measurements performed in the far-field. It is shown that the distortion undergone by a wave field as it travels through an inhomogeneous medium and the subsequent generation of local evanescent fields encode subwavelength information in the far-field due to multiple scattering within the medium. This argument is proved theoretically and supported by a limited view experiment performed with elastic waves in which an image with a resolution better than a third of the wavelength is achieved.},

	abstract = {Determining particle size and concentration in highly concentrated suspensions and emulsions is challenging, especially under process conditions. In general, ultrasound therefore can be used for particle characterisation due to the ability of sound waves to pass opaque dispersions, whereas optical detection principles mostly are limited to low particulate contents. An established acoustic method, the ultrasonic attenuation spectroscopy, uses a transmission setup for measuring the attenuation of a dispersion. A major drawback of this measurement method is caused by the fact, that the measuring gap tends to plug, which again limits the inline capability. To overcome this limitation, an ultrasonic reflection setup is used for gathering the sound waves, which are reflected, respectively backscattered by the dispersion. Statistically analysing the corresponding backscattering signal yields the sound attenuation as well as a scattering intensity equivalent. Both measurement parameters can be shown to be sensitive against particle size and concentration. Based on a single scattering theory, a semi-empirical approach is presented for interpretation of measurement results with respect to particle size and concentration. Measurements, performed on a glass beads in water dispersion, show good agreement with theory for dimensionless wave number 0.1{\textless}ka⩽1, even for concentrations up to 30vol.\%.},

In the present article we review the capability of acoustics to deliver on its potentiality to make a valuable and unique contribution to the measurement of small-scale sediment processes. The article introduces the reasons for using acoustics, the physics underlying the approach, a series of examples illustrating collected data, a discussion on some of the difficulties encountered when applying acoustics and finally a look to the future and possible new developments.},

However, they can be computationally expensive, particularly when the cost of generating individual stochastic samples is very high, as in the case of stochastic {PDEs}. Multilevel Monte Carlo is a recently developed approach which greatly reduces the computational cost by performing most simulations with low accuracy at a correspondingly low cost, with relatively few simulations being performed at high accuracy and a high cost.
In this article, we review the ideas behind the multilevel Monte Carlo method, and various recent generalizations and extensions, and discuss a number of applications which illustrate the flexibility and generality of the approach and the challenges in developing more efficient implementations with a faster rate of convergence of the multilevel correction variance.},

This tutorial review is intended to provide an accessible outline of recent basic developments. It discusses elastic electromagnetic scattering by random many-particle groups and summarizes the unified microphysical approach to radiative transfer and the effect of weak localization of electromagnetic waves (otherwise known as coherent backscattering). It explains the exact meaning of such fundamental concepts as single and multiple scattering, demonstrates how the theories of radiative transfer and weak localization originate in the Maxwell equations, and exposes and corrects certain misconceptions of the traditional phenomenological approach to radiative transfer. It also discusses the challenges facing the theories of multiple scattering, radiative transfer, and weak localization in the context of geophysical applications.},

The formula for the incoherent contribution reproduces the standard vector radiative transfer equation. The interference contribution is expressed in terms of a system of Fredholm integral equations with kernels containing Bessel functions. The special case of the backscattering direction is considered in detail.

The expressions, derived here for the first time, are valid for moderate volume fractions and without restriction on the frequency. We show that the multi-species effective wavenumber is not a straightforward extension of expressions for a single species. Comparisons are drawn with state-of-the-art models in acoustics by presenting numerical results for a concrete and a water-oil emulsion in two dimensions. The limit of when one species is much smaller than the other is also discussed and we determine the background felt by the larger species in this limit. Surprisingly, we show that the answer is not the intuitive result predicted by self-consistent multiple scattering theories. The derivation presented here applies to the scalar wave equation with cylindrical or spherical inclusions, with any distribution of sizes, densities, and wave speeds. The reflection coefficient for cylindrical inclusions is also formally derived.},

	abstract = {Current problems of the theory of multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves by discrete random media are reviewed, with an emphasis on densely packed media. All equations presented are based on the rigorous theory of electromagnetic scattering by an arbitrary system of non-spherical particles. The main relations are derived in the circular-polarization basis. By applying methods of statistical electromagnetics to a discrete random medium in the form of a plane–parallel layer, we transform these relations into equations describing the average (coherent) field and equations for the sums of ladder and cyclical diagrams in the framework of the quasi-crystalline approximation. The equation for the average field yields analytical expressions for the generalized Lorentz–Lorenz law and the generalized Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem, which are traditionally used for the calculation of the effective refractive index. By assuming that the particles are in the far-field zones of each other, we transform all equations asymptotically into the well-known equations for sparse media. Specifically, the equation for the sum of the ladder diagrams is reduced to the classical vector radiative transfer equation. We present a simple approximate solution of the equation describing the weak localization ({WL}) effect (i.e., the sum of cyclical diagrams) and validate it by using experimental and numerically exact theoretical data. Examples of the characteristics of {WL} as functions of the physical properties of a particulate medium are given. The applicability of the interference concept of {WL} to densely packed media is discussed using results of numerically exact computer solutions of the macroscopic Maxwell equations for large ensembles of spherical particles. These results show that theoretical predictions for spare media composed of non-absorbing or weakly absorbing particles are reasonably accurate if the particle packing density is less than ∼30\%. However, a further increase of the packing density and/or absorption may cause optical effects not predicted by the low-density theory and caused by near-field effects. The origin of the near-filed effects is discussed in detail.},

In this progress review, we summarize and analyze our main results obtained by means of numerically exact computer solutions of the macroscopic Maxwell equations. We consider finite scattering volumes with size parameters in the range [20,60], composed of varying numbers of randomly distributed particles with different refractive indices. The main objective of our analysis is to examine whether all backscattering effects predicted by the low-density theory of coherent backscattering ({CB}) also take place in the case of densely packed media. Based on our extensive numerical data we arrive at the following conclusions: (i) all backscattering effects predicted by the asymptotic theory of {CB} can also take place in the case of densely packed media; (ii) in the case of very large particle packing density, scattering characteristics of discrete random media can exhibit behavior not predicted by the low-density theories of {CB} and radiative transfer; (iii) increasing the absorptivity of the constituent particles can either enhance or suppress typical manifestations of {CB} depending on the particle packing density and the real part of the refractive index. Our numerical data strongly suggest that spectacular backscattering effects identified in laboratory experiments and observed for a class of high-albedo Solar System objects are caused by {CB}.},

Starting from the microscopic Maxwell-Lorentz equations, we trace the development of the first-principles formalism enabling accurate calculations of monochromatic and quasi-monochromatic scattering by static and randomly varying multiparticle groups. We illustrate how this general framework can be coupled with state-of-the-art computer solvers of the Maxwell equations and applied to direct modeling of electromagnetic scattering by representative random multi-particle groups with arbitrary packing densities. This first-principles modeling yields general physical insights unavailable with phenomenological approaches. We discuss how the first-order-scattering approximation, the radiative transfer theory, and the theory of weak localization of electromagnetic waves can be derived as immediate corollaries of the Maxwell equations for very specific and well-defined kinds of particulate medium. These recent developments confirm the mesoscopic origin of the radiative transfer, weak localization, and effective-medium regimes and help evaluate the numerical accuracy of widely used approximate modeling methodologies.},

A decomposition of the specific intensity in terms of polarization eigenmodes reveals how structural correlations, represented via the standard anisotropic scattering parameter g, affect the diffusion of polarized light.

	abstract = {We ask what can be measured from a random media by using backscattered waves, emitted from and received at one source. We show that in 2D both the particle radius and concentration can be accurately measured for particles with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This is challenging to do for a wide range of particle volume fractions, 1\% to 21\%, because for high volume fraction the effects of multiple scattering are not completely understood. Across this range we show that the concentration can be accurately measured just from the mean backscattered wave, but the particle radius requires the backscattered variance, or intensity. We also show that using incident wavenumbers 0 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.8 is ideal to measure particle radius between 0 and 2. To answer these questions we use supervised machine learning (kernel ridge regression) together with a large, precise, data set of simulated backscattered waves. One long term aim is to develop a device, powered by data, that can characterise random media from backscattering with little prior knowledge. Here we take the first steps towards this goal.},

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines , are becoming increasingly popular in the remote sensing community. They can be used to solve inverse problems as well as for data classification and clustering. The first applications of machine learning methods to remote sensing problems were mainly aimed at tasks such as land use classification , identification of specific objects (e.g. clouds) in satellite imagery, and atmospheric profiling. In the last decade, these methods have started to receive attention in the aerosol and cloud remote sensing community as tools to speed up the retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties. Machine learning methods can enter the processing chain of a remote sensing product in several ways. They have been used as stand-alone retrieval or classification algorithms, as fast approximate forward models or as part of a more complex type of algorithm. In this paper we review examples of use of machine learning techniques in the three ways mentioned above. Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical basis underlying the use of these techniques in remote sensing , as well as their advantages and disadvantages with respect to the traditional processing schemes.},

Using an example application, namely Sea Surface Temperature Prediction, we show how general background knowledge gained from physics could be used as a guideline for designing efficient Deep Learning models.

	abstract = {Global characterization of atmospheric aerosol in terms of the microphysical properties of the particles is essential for understanding the role aerosols in Earth climate [1]. For more accurate predictions of future climate the uncertainties of the net radiative forcing of aerosols in the Earth’s atmosphere must be reduced [2]. Essential parameters that are needed as input in climate models are not only the aerosol optical thickness ({AOT}), but also particle specific properties such as the aerosol mean size, the single scattering albedo ({SSA}) and the complex refractive index. The latter can be used to discriminate between absorbing and non-absorbing aerosol types, and between natural and anthropogenic aerosol. Classification of aerosol types is also very important for air-quality and health-related issues [3].{\textless}p{\textgreater} {\textless}/p{\textgreater}Remote sensing from an orbiting satellite platform is the only way to globally characterize atmospheric aerosol at a relevant timescale of \&sim; 1 day [4]. One of the few methods that can be employed for measuring the microphysical properties of aerosols is to observe both radiance and degree of linear polarization of sunlight scattered in the Earth atmosphere under different viewing directions [5][6][7]. The requirement on the absolute accuracy of the degree of linear polarization P$_{\textrm{\textit{L}}}$ is very stringent: the absolute error in P$_{\textrm{{\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}}}$ must be smaller then 0.001\&plus;0.005\&sdot;P$_{\textrm{{\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}}}$ in order to retrieve aerosol parameters with sufficient accuracy to advance climate modelling and to enable discrimination of aerosol types based on their refractive index for air-quality studies [6][7].{\textless}p{\textgreater} {\textless}/p{\textgreater}In this paper we present the {SPEX} instrument, which is a multi-angle spectropolarimeter that can comply with the polarimetric accuracy needed for characterizing aerosols in the Earth’s atmosphere. We describe the implementation of spectral polarization modulation in a prototype instrument of {SPEX} and show results of ground based measurements from which aerosol microphysical properties are retrieved.},

This review will highlight and critically review the capabilities, advantages, and drawbacks of {SEC}, analytical ultracentrifugation, and light scattering methods for characterizing aggregates with sizes below about 0.3 microns.

Surprisingly, it is found that the classical rules of homogenization must be modified in that case. The phenomenon of enhanced backscattering of light is investigated from numerical data for a dense distribution of cylinders.},

Closed form expressions for the reflection and transmission scattering matrices of finite stacks of gratings are established.

	abstract = {We address the problem of scattering and transmission of a plane flexural wave through a semi-infinite array of point scatterers/resonators, which take a variety of physically interesting forms. The mathematical model accounts for several classes of point defects, including mass-spring resonators attached to the top surface of the flexural plate and their limiting case of concentrated point masses. We also analyse the special case of resonators attached to opposite faces of the plate. The problem is reduced to a functional equation of the Wiener-Hopf type, whose kernel varies with the type of scatterer considered. A novel approach, which stems from the direct connection between the kernel function of the semi-infinite system and the quasi-periodic Green's functions for corresponding infinite systems, is used to identify special frequency regimes. We thereby demonstrate dynamically anisotropic wave effects in semi-infinite platonic crystals, with particular attention paid to designing systems to exhibit dynamic neutrality (perfect transmission) and localisation close to the structured interface.},

The exact reflection coefficient R is determined. The first method is associated with shifting the domain by a single period and subsequently considering two scatterers, one being a single scatterer and the second being the entire semi-infinite array. The second method determines the reflection coefficient {RN} associated with a finite array of N scatterers. The limit as N→∞ is then taken. In general {RN} does not converge to R in this limit, although we summarize various arguments that can be made to ensure the correct limit is achieved. The third method considers direct approaches.

Multiple scattering of the incident laser light within the holes results in an increased Raman signal due to the larger Raman sampling volume. This is important for overcoming typical sub-sampling issues encountered when employing {FT}-Raman backscattering of heterogeneous pharmaceutical tablets. Hole depth and diameter were found to be important experimental parameters and were optimized to yield the greatest signal enhancement. The {FT}-Raman spectra collected using backscattering from cylindrical–conical holes is compared to typical 180° backscattering from flat surfaces using tablet cores of Excedrin® and Vivarin®. Raman chemical images are used to establish a representative sampling area. We observe a three- to five-fold increase in the Raman intensity and a two-fold improvement in the measurement precision when sampling from cylindrical–conical holes rather than classic backscattering from flat tablet cores. Self-absorption effects on analyte band ratios are negligible in the fingerprint region but are more significant at the higher near-infrared ({NIR}) absorbances found in the C–H/O–H/–N–H stretching region. The sampling technique will facilitate developing quantitative {FT}-Raman methods for application to pharmaceutical tablets using fingerprint spectral region.},

The T-matrix is independent of several input parameters in a wave propagation model and hence the offline computation of the T-matrix provides an efficient reduced order model ({ROM}) framework for performing online scattering simulations for various choices of the input parameters. The authors developed and mathematically analyzed a numerically stable formulation for computing the T-matrix (J. Comput. Appl. Math. 234 (2010), 1702--1709). The {TMATROM} software package provides an object-oriented implementation of the numerically stable formulation and can be used in conjunction with the user’s preferred forward solver for the two-dimensional Helmholtz model. We compare {TMATROM} with standard methods to compute the T-matrix for a range of two-dimensional test scatterers with large aspect ratios and acoustic sizes. Our numerical results demonstrate the robust numerical stability of the {TMATROM} implementation, even with scatterers for which the standard methods are numerically unstable. The efficiency and flexibility of the {TMATROM} software package to handle a wide range of two-dimensional scatterers with various shapes and material properties are also demonstrated.},
