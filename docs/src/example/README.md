# Overview

## [Simple random particles](random_particles/README.md)
- Simple example of random particles in rectangle

## [Random particles in a circle](particles_in_circle/README.md)
- Generate random particles in a circle

## [StatisticalMoments](moments/README.md)
- How to extract statistical information from a batch of simulations, in this
  case: mean, standard deviation, skew and kurtosis (also known as moments).

## [Near surface backscattering](near_surface_backscattering/README.md)
- A method to calculate the backscattering from an infinite halfspace.
- See backscattering in frequency and time.
